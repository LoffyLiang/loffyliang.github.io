*I am honored that you would be interested in my experience with mathematical modeling and data mining competitions!*<br>

***I have selected some of the results I have achieved from the competitions I have entered.***

## Selected Competitions

### Sailboat Price Prediction Model - XGBoost Based on SA Split Strategy.
***Competition**: Mathematical Contest In Modeling-2023*<br>
***Brief overview of competition problems***：<br>
Model sailboat price forecasts and analyze the impact of regional economic factors on sailboat price fluctuations.<br>
***problems-solving strategy***：<br>
First, I change the strategy of selecting features when constructing sub-models in XGBoost to the SA algorithm-based approach and compare the effects of XGBoost and the Improved SA-XGBoost.<br>

Second, I compare our model with the rest of the integrated learning or deep learning models.<br>

Ultimately I used SHAP values, PDP analysis, and ICE plots to explain the conclusions drawn from the Improved SA-XGBoost model. <br>

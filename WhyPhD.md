title: Why PhD？

**Why pursue a PhD position?**

My first exposure to research was during my undergraduate studies, and I am grateful to my advisor for that experience. Together, we completed the derivation and experimental validation of the Adjust-AdaCost model. The most important takeaway for me was that a mathematics-based model leads to good results, which made me place greater emphasis on strengthening my mathematical foundation. After graduating, I aimed to pursue a PhD, but I took a moment to reflect: Do I really like this field? Am I passionate enough?

Therefore, in my first job as an algorithm engineer, I directed myself towards time series forecasting projects. Before I joined Haifang Technology, no one there was using the Transformer framework, and no one was applying AI to predict battery life. After extensive literature reviews and validation with large industry datasets (including battery life data from major Chinese battery manufacturers such as CATL and Hithium), I developed a lithium battery life prediction model with industry-leading accuracy. Starting in March of this year, I productized this algorithm and integrated it into Haifang Technology's battery algorithm platform. In addition, I independently conducted research on time series forecasting in the power system domain and submitted a paper to *Energy*.

In June this year, I received an offer from Canway to join their joint algorithm development team with Tencent. The reason I chose to join this team was to engage with more experts in the time series forecasting field. In the realm of AIOps, Tencent BlueKing’s algorithm engineers have rich experience and standards in time series applications, which I didn’t have access to in Haifang Technology due to limited AI mentorship. After a year and a half of experience as a time series algorithm engineer, I can confidently say that I am highly interested in AI, especially in spatio-temporal predictive theories. I need a long period of time and a suitable opportunity to solidify my AI theoretical foundation and contribute to the development of fields I am passionate about.

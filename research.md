### ISFormer:IMPROVED SEASONAL TRANSFORMER FOR POWER LOAD FORECASTING [First Author]
**Abstract:** There is an urgent need for intelligent systems to drive the development of global power systems. We
propose a high-precision and high-efficiency time-series prediction model, ISFormer, for short-term
high-granularity prediction of power systems based on the state-of-the-art Transformer architecture.
Previous models are based on the auto-correlation sequence-attention mechanism, however, is inef-
ficient and heavily reliant on the sample size at the sequence level. In this paper, we incorporate
the highly efficient distillation-attention mechanism and the time-sequence decomposition module
as our Transformer model kernel. The Time2Vec module is employed as the temporal information
embedding module of the model, which enhances the predictive performance and seasonal capture
ability of the model. The predictive efficacy of four distinct prediction granularities was evaluated
on four public datasets. On average, ISFormer exhibited a reduction in MSE and MAE of over 10%
compared to the existing SOTA model. The efficacy and significance of each module proposed in
this paper were assessed through comprehensive ablation experiments. In terms of time efficiency,
ISFormer demonstrated a reduction in MSE and MAE of over 30% compared to the SOTA model in
each prediction task.

### A Dynamic Cost-Adjusted Adacost Model for Credit Scoring of Smallholder Farmers[First Author]
**Abstract:**  Credit scoring models have been constrained by the problem of data imbalance. In this paper, we propos
e a dynamic cost-adjusted Adacost credit scoring model to improve its prediction accuracy. This model enriches th
e existing research methods on credit problems of smallholder farmers and opens up new avenues for the establish
ment of credit scoring models for smallholder farmers. This paper has three research highlights. Firstly, by introdu
cing a variable cost-sensitive function, each sub-model generated by the Adacost model adapts to the changing mis
classification costs. As a result, the sample weights and model weights in the subsequent sub-models that are assoc
iated with the previous ones are dynamically adjustable. This overcomes the weakness of the traditional Adacost m
odel that ignores the dynamic impact of cost-sensitive functions on sample weights and model weights. Secondly, 
by introducing PCA and using the principal components after dimension reduction for modeling, the redundancy o
f data features is removed. Thirdly, we propose an exponential cost loss function that combines the exponential fun
ction and the variable cost-sensitive function. This causes the misclassification cost of default samples between adj
acent sub-models to increase exponentially, thereby improving the efficiency of model training. Using the data of a
gricultural loans from a commercial bank in China as empirical data and comparing with seven baseline models in
cluding Adaboost, Adacost, Cost RF, Cost XGBoost, Cost SVM, Cost GBDT, and Cost DT, we found that the prop
osed dynamic cost-adjusted Adacost model outperformed the other models. Robustness tests were conducted using
two publicly available loan datasets from UCI, and the results showed that the dynamic cost-adjusted Adacost mo
del performed better than the Adaboost and Adacost models.

### Time Series Prediction: Machine Learning Models Based on Rolling-ICEEMDAN Methods[Fourth Author]
The usual EMD,EEMD,ICEEMDAN etc. methods of prediction after temporal decomposition (One-Dimensional->Higher-Dimensional) are almost always wrong because of serious data leakage problems, so the predictions obtained are very good. My research group and I proposed **Rolling-ICEEMDAN Methods**, which is an adaptive **decomposition-prediction-fusion** scheme that solves the data leakage problem well and also shows good performance.

### Intern Projects
- Shanghai Caili Internet Co., Ltd.(Jul. 2023 - Aug. 2023) <br>
*Machine Learning/Knowledge Graph Algorithm Engineer Intern* <br>
Project Introduction:<br>
  - Resume job matching application (JD anchor rating): Evaluated CV data based on JD data (provided CV’s highlights, shortcomings, and comments for certain positions’ JD).
  
  Was responsible for:  
  - Utilized LLM for data distillation; provided JD and CV data to ChatGPT and enabled ChatGPT to generate accurate highlights, shortcomings, and comments for CV through iteration and optimization of prompts.
  - Trained the JD label extraction model via the Bert-LSTM model (named entity recognition); for a JD posted by HR, extracted it into certain fields, such as education, major, professional skills, certificate, etc.; established the Bert-LSTM model, and continuously optimized and adjusted the learning rate as well as epoch to increase accuracy.
  - JD & CV anchor sorting; organized the content written by the consultant into practical and easy to program indicators.
  - Applied knowledge graphs to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of tool skills in JD & CV; utilized text similarity for analyzing and matching with knowledge graph content.

*Data Analytics Intern*  
Project Introduction:  
  - Training a large language model using RAG to answer specific marketing knowledge.
  
  Was responsible for: 
  - Optimize the workflow using RAG.
  - Fine-tune the large language model for bad case.

# About Me
Here is **Xianzhu Shao**.

I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the College of Science at Tianjin University of Commerce in June 2023. After graduation, I worked as an AI algorithm engineer at Haifang Technology from 2023 to 2024, where I was responsible for the development of **AI algorithms**, **Optimization algorithms**, and **High-performance computing**. Currently, I am part of a joint algorithm development team at **Tencent & Canway**, focusing on the development of deep learning algorithms for **AIOps** (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations).
